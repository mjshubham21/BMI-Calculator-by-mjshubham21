BMI calculator:

HTML:

Take 2 inputs from user: Height (cm) and Weight (kg).

Submit button to calculate.

CSS:

In body set margin and padding 0, change color, font and bg color.

for wrapper/container of these elements: 

- position absolute.
- some padding n bg.

for button: 

- color, padding, border
- bg, disp, margin top and cursor pointer.

JS: 

Get btn element by id.

Add event listener to btn on click.

parse H and W in int or float, get by id by value.

Create result variables to change innerHtml to display results.

H n W status to false at 1st to check inputs filled or not.

Check user given H and W if they’re filled, ≤0 and if it is a number (isNan) to throw err msg my changing innerHTML to give valid params.

if above is true set status to true.

bmi= (w/(h*h)/10000);

If inputs are correct calc bmi: 

- if bmi<18.6 show under weight.
- if bmi ≥18.6 & bmi ≤24.9 show normal.
- if bmi ≥24.9 show over weight.
- results.innerHTML for above.
This is for rough idea, be creative with it!!
